The repository contains an implementation of the first homework assignment in the Algorithms course. The skeletons of the source code (names and function descriptions) were provided by the tutors.

The task was to complete the function bodies in files c202.c, c204.c and c206.c: <br>
C202: implementation of a character stack in a dynamic array,<br>
C204: converting expressions from infix to postfix notation and evaluating them,<br>
C206: implementation of a bidirectionally linked linear list. <br>
